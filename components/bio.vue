        I live in Hong Kong, the city I will always love. &nbsp;<img

        I studied Computer Science in The Chinese University of Hong Kong. The learning never ends,
        4 years in the amazing campus goes by in a heartbeat, and everywhere I go reminds me of
        memories that would last a lifetime.

        I studied in Northeastern University for a semester as an exchange program. Boston is a city
        full of history and culture, and I will definitely miss the freezing weather.

        I worked in <a href="https://keep.edu.hk">keep.edu.hk</a> as an intern involving web
        development.

        I love movies and the art of storytelling. We only have one lifetime, but through movies we
        get to experience numerous others.

        Photography is my best buddy during my travels. Capturing genuine moments as I experience
        them gives me great satisfaction.
